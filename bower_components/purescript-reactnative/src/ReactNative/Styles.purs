-- | position in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to relative by default, so absolute positioning is always just relative to the parent.
-- | If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have absolute position.
-- | If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, just don't use styles for that. Use the component tree.
-- | See https://github.com/facebook/css-layout for more details on how position differs between React Native and CSS.

-- | left is the number of logical pixels to offset the left edge of this component.
-- | It works similarly to left in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

left :: Int -> StyleProp
left = unsafeStyleProp "left"
